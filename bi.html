			One of the challenges in modern BI is keeping up with the trends.<br /><br />
			More than that, how can you UPDATE your business to keep up with the demands, while maintaining control?<br /><br />
			It is nearly impossible to anticipate change, but you can always do your best to roll with the changes. One such concept is Data Source Agnosticism.<br /><br />
			This is the practice of not requiring a specific technology platform, so if one fails, your business will not suffer total loss of functionality.<br /><br />
			In cloud technologies, this is very important. Due to data import/export policies on cloud systems, it is prudent to have a mix, or hybrid approach.<br /><br />
			This hybrid approach is best defined as focusing on multiple vendors and database types, and tools that let you bring it all together.<br /><br />
			In one of my previous roles, I learned how to create and develop an on-premises Business Intelligence solution through Power BI Report Server.<br /><br />
			There are a few things that set it apart from other tools:<br /><br />
			<ul>
				<li>No limits on data refreshes and storage, since you control the server. (Others: Tableau Server, SAS Enterprise BI)<br /></li>
				<li>It is founded on well-known technologies:</li>
				<ul><li>REST API</li>
					<li>PowerShell</li>
					<li>T-SQL</li>
					<li>SSRS</li>
					<li>C# ASP.NET</li>
					<li>PowerQuery / M</li>
					<li>DAX</li>
				</ul>
				<li>On-Prem and Cloud BOTH. This matters because:
				<ul><li>You may want cloud features (Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence) and on-premises data control, depending on the report data in question.</li>
					<li>Data Security - One of the most pressing features these days is cybersecurity. PBIRS is useful because it exists behind your firewall, and is largely controlled by your Organization.</li>
					<li>Existing Legacy BI integration (SSRS, Access, Excel, Office Online) - This tool is one of the best at using other products in conjunction with itself.</li>
					<li>106 Data Sources - One of the best data consumers, with the right Gateway/oAuth Proxy set-up, this will let you use Cloud sources, or use an SSRS Dataset in a Power BI Report.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>The most frustrating part is the licensing:
				<ul><li>It comes *free* with an Enterprise SQL Server License, OR</li>
				    <li>You can opt for Power BI Premium which allows for increased Cloud refreshes/usage/functionality,</li>
				    <li>AND you must still have report creators with a Pro license, using either of the above options.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			One of the things people don't realize, is that you can use this and other BI tools, and sometimes they overlap, such as both can use Analysis Services or SQL Server Tables.
			Typically, there are two things that affect adoption of the tool the most:
			<ul><li>Cost</li>
				<li>Polish</li>
			</ul>
